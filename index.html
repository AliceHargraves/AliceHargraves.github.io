        <h6><em>Posted 13/06/2020</em></h6>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Push yourself to get up before the rest of the world - start with 7am, then 6am, then 5:30am. Go to the nearest hill with a big coat and a scarf and watch the sun rise.</p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown"> Push yourself to fall asleep earlier - start with 11pm, then 10pm, then 9pm. Wake up in the morning feeling re-energised and comfortable. Lie in the garden, feel the sunshine on your skin.
        </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown" > Get into the habit of cooking yourself a beautiful breakfast. Fry tomatoes and mushrooms in real butter and garlic, fry an egg, slice up a fresh avocado and squirt way too much lemon on it. Sit and eat it and do nothing else.
        </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown" >Stretch. Start by reaching for the sky as hard as you can, then trying to touch your toes. Roll your head. Stretch your fingers. Stretch everything. </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Buy a 1L water bottle. Start by pushing yourself to drink the whole thing in a day, then try drinking it twice.</p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Buy a beautiful diary and a beautiful black pen. Write down everything you do, including dinner dates, appointments, assignments, coffees, what you need to do that day, no detail is too small. </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Strip your bed of its sheets and empty your underwear drawer into the washing machine. Wash, then hang them in the sunshine with care. Make your bed in full. </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Dig your fingers into the earth, plant a seed. See your sucess as it grows everyday.</p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Organise your room. Fold all your clothes (and bag what you don't want), clean your mirror, your laptop, vacuum the floor, light a beautiful candle.</p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Breathe. Practice your deep breathing. Ground yourself.</p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Have a luxurious shower with your favourite music playing. Wash your hair, scrub your body, brush your teeth. Lather your whole body in moisturiser, get familiar with the part between your toes, your inner thighs, the back of your neck.</p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Push yourself to go for a walk. Take your headphones, go to the beach and walk. Smile at strangers walking the other way and be surprised how many smile back. Bring your dog and observe your dog's behaviour. Realise you can learn from your dog. </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Message old friends with personal jokes. Reminisce. Suggest a catch up soon, even if you don't follow through. Push yourself to follow through. </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Think long and hard about what interests you. Crime? Sex? Boarding school? Long-forgotten romance etiquette? Find a book about it and read it. There is a book about literally everything. </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Become the person you would ideally fall in love with. Let cars merge into your lane when driving. Pay double for parking tickets and leave a second one in the machine. Stick your tongue out at babies. Help an animal. Compliment people on their nice clothes. Challenge yourself to not ridicule anyone for a whole day. Then two. Then a week. Walk with a straight posture. Look people in the eye. Ask people about their story. Talk to aquaintances so they become friends. </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Lie in the sunshine. Daydream about the life you would lead if failure wasn't a thing. Open your eyes. </p>
        
        <p class="GTlockdown">Take small steps to make it happen for you....</p>

        <h2 id="Wolf">Wolf Drawing</h2>
        <h6>Posted:13/06/2020</h6>
        
        <p id="paragraph">
           This drawing has important symbolism to me, and I have found it a therapeutic task which has given me a sensation of strength and empowerment that I feel has had short term benefits for my confidence.<br>
           
        The subject matter is clear to see in this image, with a fierce wolf's head emerging from the hole in the large and bold 'A' which I have made to look simplistic, but a significant and powerful part of the image.<br>

I hope the image is pleasant and people to other people's eyes! Although I'm positive it wouldn't be to everyone's taste. However this is a drawing I made for myself which carries meaning that I wanted to convey.<br>

<br> Like many people, I was bullied in high school. I was quite different to my classmates and I went to high school without knowing anyone when everyone else already had friends from primary school, so I felt very alone. I was surrounded by girls who liked to straighten their hair and wear lots of make-up, and I hadn't reached that point by that time. And I'm glad I hadn't too. I was bullied for many reasons, but for some odd reason people loved to take the mick out of my thick wavy and frizzy hair. 'Lion girl'and 'wolf' were often banded about. Okay, not the most scarring insults. But when one day I was stood talking to 'friends' outside on my lunch break, and that afternoon found myself in floods of tears on the phone to my mum in the headmaster office after having experienced a boy 3 years older than me try to set my hair alight. I refer to them as 'friends' as they witnessed this happening and didn't react, not sticking up for me, not even reacting with shock at someone doing such a horrible thing to me. Not even making me aware that someone was behind me trying to set my hair alight.<br>
My hair became one of the parts of my body I was most self conscious about, and from the day I got my first pair of hair straighteners, nobody knew my straight hair wasn't natural for about 10 years. I wouldn't be seen outside the house without my hair having been religiously straightened.<br>
With the changing times and styles, wavy hair has come back into fashion, and it would seem that I wasn't the only one to be in the same position as me. Women have begun to embrace their wild hair, and one of my inspirations is Jilian Hervey, a wild haired beauty who calls her band name 'Lion Babe'. Respect sister.<br>
One of my favourite bands being Wolf Alice has also been the inspiration for my drawing, although they have less to do with the hair. But being called wolf as a teenager, I can't help but find it ironic! I've recently been to see this band (who were amazing by the way) and have inspired me to do this drawing, firstly as a tribute to them, but also as my self empowering middle finger to my old bullies, to tell them that yeah, I've got big frizzy hair. Or you might call it wild, wolf like, lioness. And yeah, it fucking is. And you what? I love it.
        <br>
        <br>Things have changed for me since I began this drawing. I was taking far too long on it, wonderign what I could add to it to make it more realistic, or make the wolf's face more ferocious, depicting the mood I wanted to convey. I would take weeks away from the drawing before returning to add to it, and eventually I decided that I was finished with it. Of course as you can see, it's incomplete, however I've decided that I don't want to return to this drawing for a number of reasons. <br>
            I began this drawing as a symbolism of strength and determination, and to remember who I am. The reasons I was struggling with these things happened a while ago now, and I have found my strength from other places since. What used to bother me doesn't as much anymore, and I am happy to put this drawing aside as it is now to allow me to think of other more positive things.
